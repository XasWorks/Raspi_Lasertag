# The Raspberry Pi repo

In here, you will find all the files necessary for the mobile Raspberry Pi "server system",
mainly consisting of:

- A Raspberry Pi Zero 3 with LiPo for power, providing a MQTT server and WiFi AP for off-site Lasertag games.
- A NeoPixel ring and files for a small casing, allowing for easy interaction with the system and flashy in-game stats!

Beware: This is mostly just for fun. While there WILL be one of two interesting bits, I am not sure if many things here will be of much use.
I would still love to see people making their own Lasertag sets etc. and collaborating on making a easy to use, open source DIY system <3
